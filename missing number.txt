You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing from the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.class Solution:
  
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}
Output: 5
Explanation: The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5


 def MissingNumber(self,array,n):
        total =(n*(n+1))//2
        sum_of_arr =sum(array)
        return total -sum_of_arr
